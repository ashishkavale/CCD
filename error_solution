The error you're encountering:

```
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

This error typically occurs when there is an issue with your SSH authentication. Git is trying to use SSH to communicate with GitHub, but it is either not finding a valid SSH key or the SSH key is not associated with your GitHub account.

### Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### **1. Check if You Have an SSH Key Set Up Locally**

First, check if you have an SSH key generated on your local machine.

Run the following command to see if any SSH keys are present:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

This will list all the files in your SSH directory. Look for files like `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `id_rsa.pub`, or `id_ed25519.pub`. These are your private and public SSH keys.

* If you don’t see any keys, you need to **generate a new SSH key**.

### **2. Generate a New SSH Key (If Necessary)**

If you don't have an SSH key or want to generate a new one, follow these steps:

1. **Generate the SSH Key**:
   Run the following command (replace with your GitHub email):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   If you’re using an older system that doesn’t support `ed25519`, you can use RSA:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", just press Enter to save it in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

   **Optional**: You can add a passphrase for additional security, or just press Enter for no passphrase.

2. **Start the SSH Agent**:

   After generating the key, make sure the SSH agent is running by executing the following:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

3. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:

   Add your newly created key to the SSH agent with the command:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   (If you used `id_rsa`, replace `id_ed25519` with `id_rsa`.)

### **3. Add the SSH Key to GitHub**

Now you need to add the SSH public key to your GitHub account:

1. **Copy your public SSH key** to the clipboard:

   Run the following command to display your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   (If you used `id_rsa`, use `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` instead.)

   Copy the entire key that appears in the terminal.

2. **Add the key to GitHub**:

   * Go to [GitHub SSH Keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   * Click **New SSH Key**.
   * Paste the copied SSH key into the "Key" field and give it a descriptive title (e.g., "My Laptop SSH Key").
   * Click **Add SSH Key**.

### **4. Test the SSH Connection to GitHub**

Once you've added the key to GitHub, test your SSH connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see something like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you see this, it means that your SSH key is now properly associated with your GitHub account, and you should be able to push and pull from your repository.

### **5. Check Your Remote URL**

Make sure that your remote repository URL is set to use SSH, not HTTPS. Run:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like this:

```
origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (push)
```

If it shows an HTTPS URL instead of SSH (`https://github.com/...`), you can change it to SSH with:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

### **6. Try Pushing Again**

Now that everything is set up, try pushing again:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If everything is configured correctly, the push should work without the permission error.

### **Troubleshooting Checklist**

* **Correct SSH key**: Ensure that your public key is added to GitHub and is linked with the correct GitHub account.
* **SSH agent running**: Ensure the SSH agent is running and the key is added to it.
* **Correct remote URL**: Make sure the remote URL is using SSH (`git@github.com:...`) rather than HTTPS.
* **Correct GitHub username**: Ensure you're using the correct GitHub username for your repository.
